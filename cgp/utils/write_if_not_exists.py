    """
    Context manager to open(filename, "w") only if the file does not exist.
    
    Usage:
        with write_if_not_exists(filename) as f:
            # write stuff to file
    
    If the file exists, f opens os.devnull instead of filename.
    Setting the optional keyword argument raise_if_exists=True will 
    raise OSError if the file already exists.
    
    Further usage examples, writing to a temporary directory.
    
    >>> from tempfile import mkdtemp
    >>> from shutil import rmtree
    >>> dtemp = mkdtemp()
    >>> filename = os.path.join(dtemp, "test.txt")
    
    Writing to a file that does not already exist. This works as normal.
    
    >>> with write_if_not_exists(filename) as f:
    ...     f.write("Hello world")
    11
    >>> with open(filename) as f:
    ...     f.read()
    'Hello world'
    
    Writing again is silently ignored because raise_if_exists defaults to False.
    
    >>> with write_if_not_exists(filename) as f:
    ...     f.write("filename exists, so this goes to the null device")
    48

    The file contents are unaffected.
    
    >>> with open(filename) as f:
    ...     f.read()
    'Hello world'
    
    Raising an exception if the file already exists.
    
    >>> with write_if_not_exists(filename, raise_if_exists=True):
    ...     f.write("This raises an exception") # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    OSError: File exists: ...test.txt
    
    Again, the file contents are unaffected.
    
    >>> with open(filename) as f:
    ...     f.read()
    'Hello world'
    
    >>> rmtree(dtemp) # cleanup after doctests
